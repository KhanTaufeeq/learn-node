##### Node.js runs the V8 JavaScript engine, the core of Google Chrome, outside of the browser. This allows Node.js to be very performant.

##### A thread executes the code.
##### You can write code to create and control threads.
##### Threads allow tasks to run concurrently, but the concept itself is not a block of code.

##### Node.js is lightweight and efficient because it doesnâ€™t create separate threads for each task.
##### It uses asynchronous programming to handle many tasks at once without waiting unnecessarily.
##### Developers can write code for both the frontend and backend using JavaScript.
##### Node.js makes it easy to adopt the latest JavaScript features without worrying about browser compatibility.

### A module in Node.js is:

##### A reusable block of code.
##### Exported and imported using module.exports and require.
##### Available as built-in (like fs), third-party (like express), or custom modules.
